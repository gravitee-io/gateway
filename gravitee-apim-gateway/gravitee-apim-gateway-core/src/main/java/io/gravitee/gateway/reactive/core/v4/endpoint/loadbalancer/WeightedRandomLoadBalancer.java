/**
 * This loadbalancer will randomly choose one endpoint based on total remaining weight and verify that its remaining weight is higher than 0, otherwise it will pick the next one.
 * After a selection is made, the total remaining weight is decreased.
 *
 * For example, if you have the following two endpoints:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Endpoint 1 with a weight of 9</li>
 * <li>Endpoint 2 with a weight of 1</li>
 * </ul>
 * Endpoint 1 is selected 9 times out of 10, whereas Endpoint 2 is selected only 1 time out of 10.
