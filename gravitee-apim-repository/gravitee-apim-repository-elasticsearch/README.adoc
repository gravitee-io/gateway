== Testing
By default, unit tests are run with a TestContainer version of ElasticSearch 7.17.7, but sometimes it can be useful to run them against other version of ElasticSearch.
To do so you can use the following commands:

* ES 5.x: `mvn clean test -Delasticsearch.version=5.6.16`
* ES 6.x: `mvn clean test -Delasticsearch.version=6.8.23`
* ES 7.x: `mvn clean test -Delasticsearch.version=7.17.8` (Default)
