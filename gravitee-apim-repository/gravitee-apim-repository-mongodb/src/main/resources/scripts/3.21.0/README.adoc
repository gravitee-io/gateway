= ApiType Migration

Starting from 3.21.0, when you create a v4 API the expected values for the ApiType are :

* PROXY instead of SYNC
* MESSAGE instead of ASYNC

The script api-type-migration.js aims to update the ApiType for V4 API.

NOTE: If you are not using V4 APIs (currently in beta) you don't have to execute this script.
