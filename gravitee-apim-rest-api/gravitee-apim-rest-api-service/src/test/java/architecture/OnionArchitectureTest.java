     * The domain package is the core of the application. It consists of two parts.
     *
     * - The domainModels packages contain the domain entities.
     *
     * - The packages in domainServices contains services that use the entities in the domainModel packages.
     *
     * The applicationServices packages contain services and configuration to run the application and use cases.
     * It can use the items of the domain package but there must not be any dependency from the domain to the application packages.
     *
     * The adapter package contains logic to connect to external systems and/or infrastructure.
     * No adapter may depend on another adapter. Adapters can use both the items of the domain as well as the application packages.
     * Vice versa, neither the domain nor the application packages must contain dependencies on any adapter package.
