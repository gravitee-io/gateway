= Release process

== üìù Description

This repo contains some https://github.com/google/zx[zx] scripts to execute the different release steps for APIM.

It will allow you to run these pipeline on CircleCI:

1. Release
2. Package Zip
3. Docker and RPMs
4. Generate changelog
5. Nexus Sync

== üõ† Requirement

To run the scripts, you need to have:

* Node.js >= 16.0.0 (configured in link:.nvmrc[.nvmrc]] with v18.4.0 )
* https://github.com/google/zx[zx]; to install it just run:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -g zx
# Check everything is ok:
zx -v
----
* A https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme[dotenv] file containing the variable `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`, which is your personal token on CircleCI. (https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens#creating-a-personal-api-token[How to create your CircleCI personal token ?])

== üèÅ Usage

Thanks to link:package.json[package.json], you can run those scripts as simple `npm` commands (do not forget to use `npm i` before starting).

Each of the commands needs:

* A `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` in `.env` file
* the `--version` parameter

Optional flag:

* `--dry-run`: allow to run the pipeline in dry run mode (except for `nexus_sync` which does not have this mode)

Each commands, when successful, will guide you to the next command to run, for example: `When it's done, run 'npm run nexus_sync -- --version=3.15.11'
`.

Here are the steps to run to fully release APIM (Releasing 3.15.11, in the following example):

1. `npm run release -- --version=3.15.11`
2. `npm run package_zip -- --version=3.15.11`:
 - ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ò£Ô∏è  As the release process is under stabilization, it is needed to manually update the `gravitee-api-management` version, commit and create a tag on the `release` repo. Otherwise the package bundle step will fail. This will not be needed anymore as soon as the magic python script replaced by the use of the maven distribution pom.
 - The pipeline needs versions of EE packages as parameters. There are read from link:../gravitee-apim-distribution/pom.xml[gravitee-apim-distribution/pom.xml]
3. `npm run docker_rpms -- --version=3.15.11`: You can also provide the `--latest` parameter to flag the image as `latest`.
4. `npm run changelog -- --version=3.15.11`
5. `npm run nexus_sync -- --version=3.15.11`
