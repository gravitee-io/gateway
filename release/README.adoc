= Release process

== üìù Description

This repo contains some https://github.com/google/zx[zx] scripts to execute the different release steps for APIM.

== üõ† Requirement

To run the scripts, you need to have:

* Node.js >= 16.0.0 (configured in link:.nvmrc[.nvmrc] with v18.4.0)
* https://github.com/google/zx[zx], to install it you just have to run:

[source,shell]
----
npm i -g zx
# Check everything is ok:
zx -v
----
* A https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv#readme[dotenv] file containing the variable `CIRCLECI_TOKEN`, which is your personal token on CircleCI:
 - Go to https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens, create a token and copy it
 - Run the following command in the `release` folder to create a `.env` file with the token:

[source,shell]
----
touch .env && echo "CIRCLECI_TOKEN=[YOUR_TOKEN]" > .env
----

* Some dependencies to run the scripts, you can install them with:
[source, shell]
----
# In the `release` folder
npm install
----

== üèÅ Usage[[Usage]]

=== ‚ö°Ô∏è Full release for the win!

Thanks to link:package.json[package.json], you can run those scripts as simple `npm` commands (do not forget to use `npm i` before starting).

Each of the commands needs:

* A `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` in `.env` file
* the `--version` parameter

Optional flag:

* `--dry-run`: allow to run the pipeline in dry run mode (except for `nexus_sync` which does not have this mode)
* `--latest`: to tag the docker image as the `latest`

Here is the command to fully release APIM (Releasing 3.15.11, in the following example):

`npm run full_release -- --version=3.15.11`: You can also provide the `--latest` parameter to flag the image as `latest`.

=== üêå Step by step release

It will allow you to manually trigger these workflows on CircleCI:

1. Release
2. Package Zip
3. Docker and RPMs
4. Helm Chart
5. Generate changelog
6. Nexus Sync

This is the legacy process making you execute each step manually

Thanks to link:package.json[package.json], you can run those scripts as simple `npm` commands (do not forget to use `npm i` before starting).

Each of the commands needs:

* A `CIRCLECI_TOKEN` in `.env` file
* the `--version` parameter

Optional flag:

* `--dry-run`: allow to run the pipeline in dry run mode (except for `nexus_sync` which does not have this mode)

Each command, when successful, will guide you to the next command to run, for example:

[source]
----
When it's done, run 'npm run nexus_sync -- --version=3.19.8'
----

Here are the steps to run to fully release APIM (Releasing 3.19.8, in the following example):

1. `npm run release -- --version=3.19.8`
2. `npm run package_zip -- --version=3.19.8`:
3. `npm run docker_rpms -- --version=3.19.8`: You can also provide the `--latest` parameter to flag the image as `latest`.
4. `npm run helm_chart -- --version=3.19.8`
5. `npm run release_notes -- --version=3.19.8`
6. `npm run nexus_sync -- --version=3.19.8`

== üß™ Handle pre-version releases

To create a pre-version release (like `alpha`, `beta`, RC`, `GA`, ...), you just have to change the `<sha1/>` tag in `pom.xml` file. +
This tag MUST be of the form: `-NAME.VERSION` (e.g. `-alpha.1`, `-RC.3`, ...)

[source,xml]
----
    <!-- Version properties -->
    <revision>3.20.0</revision>
    <sha1>-alpha.1</sha1>
    <changelist>-SNAPSHOT</changelist>
----

Then, follow instructions of <<Usage>> with `--version=3.20.0-alpha.1`. +
The version of the modifier will be automatically increased. (`3.20.0-alpha.2` in the example above).
